  # Getting started

  ## 1. Install the recorder

  The latest __stable version__ of asciinema can always be installed or updated
  to via [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html) (prefered) or
  easy\_install:

      sudo pip install --upgrade asciinema

  See [installation docs](#{docs_path(:installation)}) for all installation
  methods.

  ## 2. Record

  Go to your terminal and run the following command:

      $ asciinema rec

  New shell will be spawned and everything you do in it will get recorded.
  When you're finished simply exit the shell either by typing `exit`
  or hitting `<C-d>`.

  ## 3. Create profile (optional)

  If you want your recordings to be assigned to your asciinema profile and to be
  able to edit/delete them run this and follow the instructions:

      $ asciinema auth

  If you skip this step now, you can always run above command later and all
  previously recorded asciicasts will automatically get assigned to your new
  profile.
