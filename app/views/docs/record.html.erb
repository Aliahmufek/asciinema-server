# Getting started

## Install recorder script

To install or upgrade ascii.io recorder, open a terminal and run following
command:

    $ curl -sL get.ascii.io | bash

That's it! Now you can start recording your terminal sessions.

## Create profile (optional)

If you want your recordings to be assigned to your ascii.io profile run this
and follow instructions:

    $ asciiio auth

If you skip this step now, you can always run above command later and all
already recorded asciicasts will get automatically assigned to your new
profile.

Btw, see [my profile](/~sickill).

## Record

Open your terminal and run following command:

    $ asciiio

New shell instance will be opened and everything you'll do in it will be
recorded.  When you're ready to upload simply exit the shell with `exit`
command or just hit `<C-d>`.

## Advanced options

The recorder supports several command-line options. See
[here](<%= docs_path(:options) %>) for a list. You can always check what's
available with following command:

    $ asciiio -h

<% end %>
