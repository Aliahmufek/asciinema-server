  # Getting started

  ## 1. Install recorder

  ### Arch Linux

  asciinema is included in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/asciinema/):

      $ yaourt -S asciinema

  ### OSX (via Homebrew)

  If you use Homebrew then use the following formula URL:

      $ brew install https://raw.github.com/sickill/asciinema/master/homebrew/asciinema.rb

  ### Others

  To install/upgrade asciinema recorder, open a terminal and run following
  command:

      $ curl -sL get.asciinema.org | bash

  ## 2. Record

  Open your terminal and run following command:

      $ asciinema

  New shell instance will be opened and everything you'll do in it will be
  recorded. When you're ready to upload simply exit the shell with `exit`
  command or just hit `<C-d>`.

  ## 3. Create profile (optional)

  If you want your recordings to be assigned to your asciinema profile and to be
  able to edit/delete them run this and follow instructions:

      $ asciinema auth

  If you skip this step now, you can always run above command later and all
  previously recorded asciicasts will get automatically assigned to your new
  profile.

  Btw, see [my profile](/~sickill).

  ## Advanced options

  The recorder supports several command-line options. See
  [here](#{docs_path(:options)}) for details.
